          One-Punch Man (Japanese: ワンパンマン, Hepburn: Wanpanman) is a Japanese superhero manga series created by One. It tells the story of Saitama, 
          a superhero who can defeat any opponent with a single punch but seeks to find a worthy opponent after growing bored by a lack of challenge due 
          to his overwhelming strength. One wrote the original webcomic manga version in early 2009.

          A digital manga remake began publication on Shueisha's Tonari no Young Jump website in June 2012. The remake is written by One and illustrated by Yusuke Murata,
          and its chapters are periodically compiled and published into individual tankōbon volumes. As of June 2022, 26 volumes have been released. In North America, 
          Viz Media has licensed the remake manga for English language release and was serialized in its Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine.

          An anime adaptation, produced by Madhouse, was broadcast in Japan from October to December 2015. A second season, produced by J.C.Staff, was broadcast from April 
           to July 2019. The anime series is licensed in North America by Viz Media, and premiered in the United States on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in July 2016. 
           The second season premiered in October 2019.

As of June 2012, the original webcomic manga surpassed 7.9 million hits. As of April 2020, the manga remake had sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series.
